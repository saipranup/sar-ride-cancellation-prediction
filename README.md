# SAR Ride Cancellation Prediction Project

This project analyzes ride cancellation patterns for SAR Auto Rental, using machine learning techniques to identify high-risk bookings and improve operational efficiency.

---

## Files Included

- `SAR_Cancellation_Analysis.R`: R script containing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- `SAR_Project_Report.docx`: Final written report describing the problem, methods, results, and recommendations
- `SAR_Rental.csv`: Original dataset used for analysis

---

## Project Objective

To reduce ride cancellations by predicting which bookings are most likely to be cancelled, enabling SAR Auto Rental to take preventive actions.

---

## Key Techniques Used

- Data cleaning and imputation
- Feature engineering (trip duration, geographic zones, time of day)
- Handling class imbalance via oversampling
- Random Forest and Logistic Regression modeling
- Model evaluation using accuracy, ROC curve, AUC, and confusion matrix

---

## Project Outcome

The project successfully identified key predictors of ride cancellation, such as booking patterns and trip time windows. The best-performing model provided actionable insights to help SAR optimize their operations and minimize cancellation-related losses.
